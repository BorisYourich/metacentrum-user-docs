# PBSmon

**[PBSmon](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/index.html)** (shorthand from "PBS monitor") is a **web frontend** where

- **live data** concerning jobs, computing nodes and queues can be found,
- useful **qsub assembler** is available to users,
- specifications of **hardware** in use is collected,
- **news and outages** are published,
- **user quota overview** can be found,
- **license agreements** for licensed software are available, as well as
- some other **useful links** concerning account management and other miscella.

!!! note
    **PBSmon** is **not necessary for logging in**, neither it is essential for full-featured usage of Metacentrum grid. In principle all information displayed by PBSmon can be obtained through command-line interface, and all tasks connected with account management can be conducted via the [Perun user management system](https://perun.e-infra.cz/login). If you are new to Metacentrum, you can skip exploring the PBSmon service for now; later, as the list and complexity of your jobs grows, you will probably find it more useful.
 


## News and outages

Updates concerning changes in MetaCentrum infrastructure (PBS parameters changes, new hardware, **planned** outages...) are found under the [Current affairs -> News](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/news/news.jsp) tab.

Updates concerning **unplanned** outages, failures and emergencies are found under the [Current affairs -> Outages](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/news/outages.jsp) tab.

## Account, quotas etc.

Various links concerning 

- account management (prolongation),
- quotas (quotas status, request to change quota),
- publications (link to fill in publications),
- licence agreements (licensed software)

can be found under the [My account](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/myaccount/index.html) tab.

## PBSmon

In principle most data concerning the state of MetaCentrum grid infrastructure - your jobs, state of queues, computing node load - can be obtained through CLI from a terminal.

This is not the most convenient way for many users, however. Thet's why there exists a web-based frontend which collects and displays current state of the infrastructure. This service is called [PBSmon (PBS monitor)](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/state/index.html).



- PBSmon (PBS monitor) is a web based frontend to live data from grid... OK
- list of your jobs, other user's jobs, queues, physical state of computational nodes...
- also links to account prolongation requests
- also links to quotas, publications....
- PLUS: news and outpages
