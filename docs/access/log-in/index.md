If you log in for the first time, you will be probably prompted by a query similar to the following:

    The authenticity of host 'skirit.ics.muni.cz (2001:718:ff01:1:216:3eff:fe20:382)' can't be
    established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Splg9bGTNCeVSLE0E4tB30pcLS80sWuv0ezHrH1p0xE.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Type "yes" and hit Enter. After that you will be prompted for a MetaCentrum password, type it and hit Enter.
