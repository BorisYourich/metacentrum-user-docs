# Contact

## User support request

- Email <meta@cesnet.cz>
- Working hours Mo - Fri, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. (national holiday excluded) 
- **budeme mít něco jako hotline/emergency line / telefon - zkrátka nějaký point of contact jiný než email?**

!!! note

    The <meta@cesnet.cz> email will target Metacentrum service support team only. If your issue spans broader than Metacentrum, or if you are not sure which computing service is the one you need to contact, address the request to the top-level EINFRA user support <einfra-support@einfra.cz>.
	

## How to write good user support request

The people in user support team aere not omniscient. By keeping to several *dos* and *donts* you can help them to localize your problem faster.

### Identify yourself

Apart from your civil name, always include your username (login) also. There may be more people with identical name/surname. The username, on the other hand, is unique.

### Describe the environment you work from

Specify full job ID, directory you work from, which modules were loaded. Some applications can be run by several ways - e.g. loaded as a module or run as a Singularity image. If this is the case, specify which way you used.

### Include error in copy-paste style

Don't be afraid to copy-paste error messages into your request. If the error message is too long, include it in a separate file. Writing "program XY has problem with library YY" does not help us much. Where is the library? What problem exactly? We need to see details.

### Write a descriptive subject

This seems tricky if you don't know what is the cause Simply describe in the subject what you observe at that point. Use formulations like "Ansys fails right after start" rather than "Problem with Ansys", or "I need help with installing XY by Conda" rather than "Question about installation".

### Tell us which parts of documentation you searched through

Often our first action is to navigate user to a certain section of documentation. If you have already read through the documentation and it did not help solve your issue, tell us about this! It will save your time. Plus, it is the good feedback for us that the documentation is possibly not quite clear and/or complete.

### Tell us also what worked

If you have a slightly alternate example that **did** work, tell us about it. E.g. if the job runs OK on some cluster, but fails on another; if it runs on one CPU, but fails on two or more; if it runs with a certain parameter, but fails with different one... you get it.
 
### If possible, prepare a smallest possible example how to reproduce the issue

If you have already investigated the problem on your own, you might have some reduced example how to reproduce the failure. Attach this example or a link to a directory where we can find it. 

### Don't send your request to staff members directly

Always send requests to user support team instead of staff members directly. The emails sent to <meta@cesnet.cz> get tracked by our Request tracking system, are visible to all members of user support and will be picked up by the correct specialist. Some staff members work only part time at US desk. And anyone may be sick or on holiday sometimes.

### New problem, new request

For new issues unrelated to your previous one, write a new request. Do not respond to your latest email from user support - this will reopen your old ticket.

### Tell us also about what you finally need to achieve aka avoid "The XY problem"

#### What is it?

The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. A typical setup is as follows:

- User wants to do X.
- User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can do it if they can just manage to do Y.
- User doesn't know how to do Y either.
- User asks for help with Y.
- Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
- After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.

#### What to do about it?

To avoid the XY problem, if you struggle with Y but really what you are after is X, please also tell us about X. Tell us what you really want to achieve. Solving Y can take a long time.
