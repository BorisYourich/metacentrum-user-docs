# What are the default parameters in qsub command?

If you don't specify the queue and limit of memory, processors and nodes, the defaults are 400 MB of memory, 24 hours of walltime and 1 CPU. The walltime limit can be extended (see FAQ/Grid computing). Other resources cannot be changed after the job is submitted.
