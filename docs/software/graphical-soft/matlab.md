# Matlab

MATLAB is an integrated system covering tools for symbolic and numeric computations, analyses and data visualizations, modeling and simulations of real processes.

## OnDemand

Matlab can be run in a browser as [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz). This is the most straighforward and simplest way.

## Jupyter notebook

Matlab is available to run from [cloud Jupyter Notebook service](https://hub.cloud.e-infra.cz/hub/) as described in [Jupyter notebook documentation](http://docs.cerit.io/docs/jupyterhub.html).

## Kubernetes

Another option is to use [Kubernetes service](https://docs.cerit.io/), which offers [Matlab](https://docs.cerit.io/docs/matlab.html) as a [Rancher application](https://docs.cerit.io/docs/rancher.html).

## Remote desktop 

Using [Remote desktop](/advanced/run-graphical), Matlab can be also run from a module.

This option is recommended to advanced users or as a fallback option in case OnDemand and/or Kubernetes service are down.

**Module:**
