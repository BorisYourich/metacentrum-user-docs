## Description

TotalView is the most commonly used debugging tool providing an interactive graphical user interface for debugging both single-threaded and parallel/distributed applications. It supports most common programming models and libraries such as MPI, OpenMP, Threads, PVM, HPF, Shmem and fork/exec, including the GPU/CUDA and Xeon Phi debugging. Besides the basic functionality available in most debuggers, the TotalView provides advanced memory-debugging functionality (through the MemoryScape module), non-interactive debugging of batch jobs (via the TVScript module), and a unique opportunity to perform reverse-debugging possibilities (debugging "from mistakes to causes" - via the ReplayEngine module). 

## Usage

**Licensing:** the application is licensed for 64 simultaneously debugged processes (so-called tokens).
