# ANSYS

[ANSYS](https://customercenter.ansys.com/) is a general nonlinear multiphysics software offering structural and thermodynamic analysis, continuum flow analysis, analysis of electrostatic and electromagnetic fields and acoustic analysis.

## OnDemand

ANSYS can be run in a browser as [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz). This is the most straighforward and simplest way.

## Kubernetes

Another option is to use [Kubernetes service](https://docs.cerit.io/), which offers [ANSYS application](https://docs.cerit.io/docs/ansys.html) as a Rancher application.

## Remote desktop 

Using [Remote desktop](/advanced/run-graphical), ANSYS can be also run from a module.

This option is recommended to advanced users or as a fallback option in case OnDemand and/or Kubernetes service are down.

**Module**
